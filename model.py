Information about architecture config:
Tuple is structured by (filters, kernel_size, stride) 
Every conv is a same convolution. 
List is structured by "B" indicating a residual block followed by the number of repeats
"S" is for scale prediction block and computing the yolo loss
"U" is for upsampling the feature map and concatenating with a previous layer
